  <title>Submission of assignment</title>
  <text texttype="text/html">&lt;p&gt;Does anyone here think that using youtube as submitting assignments for this class rather off? Or is it just me? I don't believe we need make the pro folio inn our class work out in public so soon. I would feel better to do this more after all the lessons so we have a much better understanding and our photos would look even better from when we just started. I'm thinking that to should just be a gathering of us ART 240 students to see how we are handling the shots.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</text>
