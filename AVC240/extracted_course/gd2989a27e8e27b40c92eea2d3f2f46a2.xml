  <title>Final Feedback Session</title>
  <text texttype="text/html">&lt;p&gt;Our final feedback session will be Wednesday December 11th at 2:00 PM. I encourage (but do not require) everyone (even those who were not able to regularly attend in person) to try to attend to celebrate all the great work in this class this semester. There is no class on Monday December 9th.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</text>
