<p><strong>Class Resources</strong></p>
<p><strong>Student Email</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Maricopa Blackboard System uses our official student email system which is a Gmail account. All official communication for this course will occur through your student email account. &nbsp;There is more information about this email account and how to access it here:&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<strong><a class="external" href="http://www.gccaz.edu/hd/Email/gmail/gmail.htm" target="_blank"><span><span>MCCCD Student Email</span></span></a>&nbsp;(Maricopa Gmail) information&nbsp;</strong><strong>The Helpdesk on campus&nbsp;<span id="gc-number-0" class="gc-cs-link">(623) 845-3555</span>&nbsp;can also help you with Maricopa Gmail.&nbsp;</strong><strong><strong>You are responsible for checking this account regularly.</strong>&nbsp;This is how you will receive official communication from this class and GCC.&nbsp;<strong>Please establish your Maricopa Gmail account right away.</strong></strong>
</li>
<li><strong><a class="external" href="https://google.maricopa.edu/" target="_blank"><span><span>MCCCD Student Email</span></span></a>&nbsp;(Maricopa Gmail) login</strong></li>
<li>If you have another email account you are used to using, you may forward your Maricopa Gmail account to that account after you have established it. Login to your Maricopa Gmail, then go to&nbsp;<strong>Setti</strong><strong>ngs</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Forwarding</strong>. Do not "keep messages on server" as your inbox has a size limit and mail will not be received if your limit is reached.</li>
<li>If you already use Gmail for your personal mail, you will notice you can set up all of your Gmail accounts as one account and forward to that one account and send from that one account (with different addresses) if you would like to. It is very convenient and user friendly.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You can create an&nbsp;<strong>alias</strong>&nbsp;for your Maricopa Gmail so instead of your MEID, it shows your name or your email handle you like. For example an official student email looks like this with an MEID AABBC04441@maricopa.edu but you can create an alias that is firstname.lastname@maricopa.edu using Settings.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<div>
<div><strong>Computer Hardware and Software</strong></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>If you plan to use your own computer at home or work, you will need the&nbsp;<strong>Adobe Creative Suite</strong>&nbsp;software which is industry standard for Graphic Design professionals. The version in our classrooms and labs is version 5.5.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Adobe offers free 30 day trial versions of the software you can download&nbsp;<em>if you have not already used them prior to this</em>. This class is 8 weeks though and the trial is only for 30 days.</li>
<ul>
<li><strong><a class="external" href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/tdrc/index.cfm?product=illustrator" target="_blank"><span><span>Adobe Illustrator trial version</span></span></a></strong></li>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><strong>Lynda.com</strong></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>This course uses Lynda.com tutorials instead of a textbook. As a Digital Arts student, you have access to the entire library of Lynda.com videos that have been purchased by the student fees you paid as part of this class.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<div>To create your account:
<div>
<ol>
<li>Follow this link to&nbsp;<a class="external" href="http://libproxy.gc.maricopa.edu/login?url=http://iplogin.lynda.com" target="_blank"><span><span><strong>GCC Lynda.com</strong></span></span></a>, this takes you to the Library database login site.</li>
<li>Login with your eGCC username and password. This is a combination of your first initial, last name and possibly some numbers, it is not your MEID. If you don't know what this is, please contact the Helpdesk&nbsp;<a href="mailto:Helpdesk@gcmail.maricopa.edu">Helpdesk@gcmail.maricopa.edu</a>&nbsp;or 623-845-3555.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You may get a message saying this is not a trusted site. You can add this site to your browser's trusted site or ignore it.</li>
<li>You should see the Lynda.com login page. The first time you login you will need to create your account on the right side. You can use any account name you wish and enter any email address you wish. Each time you login after your account is created, you will do so from the left side of this page.</li>
<li>You now have access to over 65,000 tutorial videos on&nbsp;<strong><a class="external" href="http://lynda.com/" target="_blank"><span><span>Lynda.com</span></span></a></strong>&nbsp;to help you be successful as a Digital Arts student.</li>
<li>You will need to use the GCC Lynda.com link above (also in the course menu bar) to access this resource. If you try to login on the main Lynda.com site, your username and password will not work.</li>
<li>If you have questions or are unable to login, please contact your instructor.</li>
</ol>
<div><strong>Dropbox</strong></div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>I highly&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;that all Digital Media Arts students use Dropbox as a form of cloud backup. You can sign up for a free 4GB account at&nbsp;<a class="external" href="http://dropbox.com/" target="_blank"><span><span>dropbox.com</span></span></a>
