<p>The "picture plane" in <em>Understanding Comics</em> has three corners: reality, icon, and abstraction.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reality: the image looks similar to how we experience it everyday experience</li>
<li>Icon: the image is a greatly simplified version that retains enough elements to still be identifiable as the object.</li>
<li>Abstraction: the image has been broken down into component lines and shapes, and does not retain the identity of the original image.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your project is to create an Edge Animate project that allows the user to explore the "picture plane." The patch should take user input (mouse, button, etc.) and use that to explore the <strong>same subject</strong> as it is represented on the three corners of the "picture plane." Please watch the tutorial for an example project.</p>
<p>You will need to address several issues.</p>
<ol>
<li>How will your patch communicate to the user how it functions?</li>
<li>How will your patch transition the imagery between the three different corners of the picture plane?</li>
<li>What subject will you select to represent with three different versions?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Deliverable:</strong></p>
<p>A zip file containing the edge animate project folder, and a 200 word description of how you put this project together and how you overcame your creative and technical obstacles.&nbsp;</p>
