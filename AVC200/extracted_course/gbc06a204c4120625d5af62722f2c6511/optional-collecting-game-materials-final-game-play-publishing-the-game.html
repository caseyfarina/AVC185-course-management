<p>Finalize the materials and Lights in the game. Please use the following shadergraph shaders add stripes and textures to the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two approaches to lighting the level</p>
<ol>
<li>A Directional Light to simulate Outdoor Light</li>
<li>A series of&nbsp; spot lights<strong> </strong>to simulate indoor light
<ul>
<li>Do not use more than 20 lights</li>
<li>Do not add too much tint to the lights. It will look cheesy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep the game within a well design color palette. Do not use the default smoothness and metallic settings on every object. Make decisions about the surface of the objects. Should they be dull or shiny? Should they be plastic or metallic?</p>
<p><a href="https://texturehaven.com/">Texture Haven</a> is a good source for textures for your surfaces</p>
<ul>
<li>Not every surface needs a texture. Try to make aesthetic decisions about where to increase detail.</li>
<li>Only download the 2K albedo (color, diffuse) and the 2k normal png.</li>
</ul>
