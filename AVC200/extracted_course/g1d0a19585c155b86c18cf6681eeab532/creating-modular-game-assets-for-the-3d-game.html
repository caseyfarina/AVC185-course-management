<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Reference:</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Use these creation tutorials as a guideline. Please do not copy my designs exactly. Develop your own design in Cinema 4D and Substance Painter.</strong></p>
<p>Creating a one unit platform and one unit stairs.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Set the Unity editor snap settings to 0.5 x 0.5 y 0.5 z</li>
<li>Use the emission channel in substance painter to add lights to the modular assets</li>
<li>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Create the following modular game assets. Create textures for each element using Substance Painter. Feel free to create other assets as well.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Platform</li>
<li>Stairs with separate collider mesh</li>
<li>Vertical Environment Asset</li>
<li>Short Environment Asset</li>
<li>Gateway Environment Asset</li>
</ul>
<p>Import all of the of the meshes and textures into Unity. Create new materials for each asset and arrange all of your assets (and floor tiles) into a section of a level.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Deliverable:</strong></p>
<p>Use OBS to record the Unity editor and clearly show how all of the environment assets fit together using the grid.</p>
<p>Upload your mp4 to this assignment and upload it to slack. Please comment on three other students' posts and discuss how you designed your assets. What went well? What was difficult.&nbsp;</p>
