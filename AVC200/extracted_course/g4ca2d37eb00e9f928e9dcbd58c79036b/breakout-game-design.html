<title>Assignment: BreakOut: Game Design</title>
</head>
<body>
<p><strong>Reference: Historical Context</strong></p>
<p><em>This project in ART 200 originally started as a pong spin off, however, for reasons that mirror the historical progression from pong to breakout, it makes more sense for us to work on a one player game. We are setting up the fundamental visual appearance&nbsp;this week and next week we'll be working on the sound design, user interface and effects. <span style="color: #3598db;">Breakout..... the single player Pong.&nbsp;</span></em></p>

<p>We'll download the starting project for this project from Github. Github is a code repository on the web that stores versions of software while it is in development.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/caseyfarina/BreakOut-Unity" target="_blank">https://github.com/caseyfarina/BreakOut-Unity</a></strong></p>
<p>Click on "Code" then "download Zip."</p>

<p>Then open Unity Hub. Make sure you have 2021.3 installed. Click on "open" and select the Breakout-Unity folder <span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong>(be sure it is the folder that is ONE level above the assets folder. If not Unity will not recognize the folder as a Unity project).</strong></span> If your version of 2021.3 is slightly different it may tell you that you have to upgrade or downgrade the project to open it. Say yes. Remember even if it goes terribly wrong you can redownload the original and start over.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your assignment is to create your own breakout game with a visual theme.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>On paper sketch three different possible themes for the game. Think about what each of the important game components would look like in the game design. I want you to sketch out three different themes on paper then choose which one seems to make sense or you're most attracted to to move forward with the design. <strong>Possible themes: machines, fruit, forest, computers, desert, or think of your own ideas. <span style="color: #e03e2d;">Please do not use a copyright protected IP (pokemon, transformers, avengers, mario, etc)</span></strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">.</span> Please check out this article and video about&nbsp; Tetris Effect <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2018/11/9/18079222/tetris-effect-review-ps4-psvr" target="_blank">https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2018/11/9/18079222/tetris-effect-review-ps4-psvr</a> . This game does an excellent job of giving each level a theme. We're only creating one level, but there is much inspiration to be found here.&nbsp;
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>player</li>
<li>bricks (DOES NOT HAVE TO BE BRICK SHAPED) (5 different types)</li>
<li>moving obstacles (with animations triggered by collision)</li>
<li>background</li>
<li>walls</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Choose the design you like best and start creating sprite designs for these components in any manner you like.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>VISUAL DESIGN: </strong>Create your own sprites for each of the following. Import a spritesheet or individual sprites. Please use a coherent color palette. Decide if your sprites will be outlined or not. Do not mix outlined and non outlined sprites. You may use any graphics program to create sprites for the game. Be sure to save them in the PNG format with a transparent background. You may create the sprites in any manner (photos, illustrator, draw with pencil, paint, sculpt with clay, collage), <strong>you may not use someone else's clip art. How does the theme relate to the visual style?</strong> (I will ask you this question.)
<ul>
<li>Paddle</li>
<li>Ball</li>
<li>Walls (Invisible? Translucent)</li>
<li>Background (2D or 3D, is there a picture in the background? Or a 3D scene like Tetris Effect?)</li>
<li>Bricks (5 different designs,<span style="color: #e03e2d;"> They DO NOT have to look like bricks.</span> The shape and the function are your decision as the game designer)
<ul>
<li>A great tip for distributing objects evenly (or randomly in Unity) <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://manuel-rauber.com/2022/04/28/linear-or-random-distribution-of-gameobjects-in-the-inspector/#:~:text=Select%20a%20bunch%20of%20objects,items%20between%200%20and%20100.&amp;text=Also%20works%20with%20rotation%20and%20scale." target="_blank">Distributing objects in space</a>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Obstacles (3 different designs, must include animation trigger and script animated objects)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GAME DESIGN: </strong>Customize the game by making decisions about the following to create a dynamic experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>paddle size</li>
<li>ball size</li>
<li>ball serve speed</li>
<li>paddle speed</li>
<li>number of bricks</li>
<li>number of obstacles</li>
<li>size of obstacles</li>
<li>number of brick hit points</li>
</ul>
<p>TARGET: three minutes of gameplay</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Deliverable: </strong>Please zip up the following</p>
<ul>
<li>an mp4 of your game play</li>
<li>all three of your pen and paper sketches. Post these on the slack during the week as well if you're having a hard time deciding which one to choose.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Post your gameplay video on slack and comment on three other students' videos. We'll be designing the UI and sounds next week.&nbsp;</p>
