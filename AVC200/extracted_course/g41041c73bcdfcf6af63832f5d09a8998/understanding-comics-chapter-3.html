<p>Please respond to the following questions about chapter 3.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the name for the space in between comic panels and what&nbsp;abstract&nbsp;phenomenon does it engage in the storytelling process? How would you explain this concept to someone who was unfamiliar with comics?</li>
<li>Describe the six different categories of closure and create your own example for each one (draw, photograph, &nbsp;etc).&nbsp;</li>
<li>According to McCloud which of the five sense is engaged in a typical comic experience? How does that change "in the gutter?"</li>
<li>How does an image's position on the triangle of pictorial vocabulary affect it's degree of closure? Do you agree McCloud's assessment of this topic?</li>
<li>Pick at least two pages from a comic you appreciate (please scan them) and and analyze the closure between the panels. Create a tally similar to the one McCloud uses on pages 76-77. How does your comic fit into the "east vs. west" paradigm?</li>
</ol>
