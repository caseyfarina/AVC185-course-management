<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>We need to become familiar with animation in the aptly named <em>Edge Animate</em>. For those of you that have experience with other animation tools (Cinema 4D, After Effects) you'll find that Edge Animate functions in much the same way.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Reference</h4>
<p>In order to complete this project you need to watch and take notes on the first <strong>seven</strong> videos in <strong>Chapter 6,</strong> and the first<strong> four </strong>videos in<strong> Chapter 4</strong> in the Lynda.com Series <em>Edge Animate Essential Training with Chis Converse</em>.</p>

<h4>Project</h4>
<p>Use your forest project as a starting point to add some animated elements to the forest environment. Feel free to make changes to the forest scene to facilitate the animation requirement below and to improve the look and "feel" of your scene. Make your scene BUILD onto the screen. End with the title.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>A symbol that animates along a path</li>
<li>A symbol that animates using a nonlinear mode of easing for position.</li>
<li>A symbol that animates using a nonlinear mode of easing for scale.</li>
<li>A symbol that animates using a nonlinear mode of easing for rotation.</li>
<li>3 symbols that have looping animation.</li>
<li>A symbol that has animated image filter properties.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Deliverable</h4>
<p>Please turn in a ZIP file of your entire project folder and a 200 word document that explains how your scene meets the requirements of the project. Also discuss any problems you had and ideas for elements that you would like to include in the future. PLEASE DO NOT SUBMIT WPS FILES FOR YOUR DOCUMENT. Acceptable file formats are .doc, .rtf, .txt, .docx.</p>
<ul>
<li>ZIP of your project folder</li>
<li>Word doc discussing how your forest project meets the requirements of the project</li>
