<title>Assignment: Edge Animate Orientation: Forest Scene</title>
</head>
<body>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Over the course of the semester we'll be combining the concepts of visual representation that we learn from <em>Understanding Comics</em> and implementing them in <em>Adobe Edge Animate</em>. In order to do this, we need to become comfortable using <em>Edge Animate (EA). </em></p>
<h4>Reference</h4>
<p>In order to complete this project you need to watch and take notes on Chapters 1 <strong>and</strong> 2 in the Lynda.com Series <em>Edge Animate Essential Training with Chis Converse</em>. <span class="author"></span></p>
<h4>Project</h4>
<p>Please create your own <strong>forest</strong> scene in EA that uses the following elements. You may use elements beyond what is listed below, but your scene must include at least these elements. Please make sure the stage is set to 1000 pixels by 700 pixels.</p>
<ul>
<li>A rectangle with asymmetrically rounded corners</li>
<li>An ellipse that is clipped using the clipping tool</li>
<li>Another ellipse that is colored using the gradient tool</li>
<li>Use a text box and one of the Adobe CC Fonts to create a title for you scene. The title should be "<em>A Forest of Interactivity</em>"</li>
<li>
<strong>Three</strong> elements you created in Illustrator (probably objects)</li>
<li>
<strong>Two</strong> elements you created in Photoshop (probably textures)</li>
</ul>
<p>Your scene should adhere to the <a href="https://vimeo.com/32944253">basic rules of design and look aesthetically pleasing.</a> Be sure to properly format and design your type. <strong>Review</strong> the use of grids in type layout by watching the Lynda.com Series <em>Foundations of Typography: Working with Grids with Ina Saltz</em>.</p>
<p>I would strongly suggest generating or selecting a color palette from <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/">KULER.</a></p>
<h4>Deliverable</h4>
<p>Please turn in a ZIP file of your entire project folder and a 200 word document that explains how your scene meets the requirements of the project. Also discuss any problems you had and ideas for elements that you would like to include in the future. PLEASE DO NOT SUBMIT WPS FILES FOR YOUR DOCUMENT. Acceptable file formats are .doc, .rtf, .txt, .docx.</p>
<ul>
<li>ZIP of your project folder</li>
<li>Word doc discussing how your forest project meets the requirements of the project</li>
</ul>
