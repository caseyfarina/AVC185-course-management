<p><em><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">So this week I would like to see everyone for at least a 15 minute intro. </span></strong></span></em></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I am making a google meeting and when you're ready to meet, just click on the link. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">If you're on your phone, you should download the google meet app. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">If you have specific questions and want to share your screen, then you should meet from your computer. I believe this link will stay the same all semester. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I'll be available between <em><strong>10 AM and 3 PM on Monday and Wednesday. </strong></em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Go ahead a reserve a 15 minute time slot in the comments <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>on Slack</strong></span>. If you <span style="color: #ff6600;">can't make any of those times send me an email and we'll find a time</span>.<em><strong> I'm not going to confirm every meeting in the comments as long as it's between 10 AM and 3 PM on M W. </strong></em></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">You should click on the link and join the meeting at that time. I'll already by on the meeting. <span style="color: #ff00ff;">You need to initiate your side of the meeting.</span></span></li>
