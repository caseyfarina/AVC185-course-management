<p>Create your own set of modular tiles to use as the floor in your 3D game.&nbsp; Add some smaller details (to start establishing the world in your game).</p>
<p><strong>First tile set</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Straight path</li>
<li>Turn path</li>
<li>Intersection path</li>
<li>Blank path</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Second tile set</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>four different tiles of your own design that integrate with the four original tiles. What other tiles can you imagine needing as your begin to layout the level of your 3D game? (path termination? power up? ) You are required to make some of your own alphas and textures that you could use in substance. Use these in your tile designs.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Deliverable:</strong></p>
<p>A screen recording (OBS of the unity editor) showing off all eight of your tile designs. Demonstrate that all eight will tile seamlessly.&nbsp;</p>
