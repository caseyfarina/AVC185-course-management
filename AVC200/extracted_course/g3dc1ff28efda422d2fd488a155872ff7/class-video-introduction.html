<p><strong>Each week you'll be required to submit a video presenting the work from that week. I'll ask you to use OBS to create these presentation videos. Each week in class I'll play these videos back and discuss your work.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">I strongly encourage everyone to appear on screen (camera on) in the introduction and all of the weekly presentation videos. It is not an official requirement, however, since this is a class that combines "in person" and "online" students appearing on camera allows us all to build a real sense of community. By not turning your camera on you create a sense of asymmetry in the class environment.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
