<p>The above tutorials detail how to create a standard four state button in Edge Animate, and an animated four state button in edge animate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this project you will need to turn in five Edge Animate Projects (properly named folders including all the associated files.) For the first two projects you will simply follow the tutorials above. Then I would like you to create three buttons that you will use in an upcoming application that we're designing. These buttons should each have an icon on them (please review your "understanding comics and design" assignment"): an icon for REALISTIC, an icon for ICONIC, and an icon for ABSTRACT (review the picture plane in the McCloud text). These buttons should NOT include text. Communicate the concept as best you can using an Icon.</p>
<p>To review, please turn in the following</p>
<ol>
<li>Follow the first tutorial to create your own simple four state button.</li>
<li>Follow the second tutorial to create your own animated four state button.</li>
<li>ICONIC&nbsp;button</li>
<li>REALISTIC button</li>
<li>ABSTRACT button</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">CLARIFICATION: I would recommend starting with your button design by using the images that McCloud puts at the corners of the picture plane to represent ICON (smiley face), ABSTRACT (some shapes), and REALISTIC (a realistic face image). We are going to be using these buttons in an upcoming project so be sure that the totality of the design makes sense. Your buttons should communicate the ideas ICON, REALISTIC, and ABSTRACT without using any words.</span></p>

<p>Put all of the projects in a single folder, ZIP that folder, and upload it to this project.</p>
