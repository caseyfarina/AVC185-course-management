<title>Assignment: Finishing Game Effects and Publishing the Games</title>
</head>
<body>
<h3>Adding Sound and Particle Effects</h3>
<p>Adding effects to the breakout game and the collecting game. The structure is the same in both games, any script with an effect field can be used to instantiate a sound and particle effect. Add<strong> at least (more for a better experience) </strong>one triggered sound and particle effect to the breakout game and the collecting game.</p>

<h3>Add Background Music to Both Games</h3>

<p>Add a background music track to both the breakout and the collecting game. Be sure to adjust the volume so the sound effects can still be heard.&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<h3>Add Environmental Particle Effects</h3>
<p>Add enhanced environmental particle effect to the collecting game. These are particle effects that are not triggered by the game play but rather serve to enhance the world building experience.&nbsp; Create at least three distinct effects for the 3d game. Be creative, use these videos as a starting point for your own explorations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bubbles, OOZ, flow, fire, lightning</p>

<hr>
<p>Publish the 3D exploring game to itch.io.&nbsp; First make an account on itch.io</p>
<p><a href="https://itch.io/" target="_blank">https://itch.io/</a></p>
<p>I updated the process to make sure the games were published at a usable resolution.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>If publishing the WebGL version of the game is giving you problems you can also </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>build a windows version of the game</li>
<li>zip up the game folder</li>
<li>upload to google drive</li>
<li>set the google drive zip sharing preferences to "everyone with link"</li>
<li>Post the google drive link to this assignment and on slack.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Deliverable:</strong></p>
<p>Post the link to both games and your shelf experience on Itch.io to this assignment<strong> and on Slack.</strong> Play test the other students games and let them know what worked and what you think could be improved in the slack comments.&nbsp;</p>
