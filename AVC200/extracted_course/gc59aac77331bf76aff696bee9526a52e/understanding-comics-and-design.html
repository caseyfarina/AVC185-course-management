<p>As we continue to explore the ideas that McCloud presents in Understanding Comics you should consider how those ideas can be applied to media design. For instance <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Hertzfeld">Andy Hertzfeldt</a>, one of the original designers of the Macintosh, commented on McCloud's opus,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>"Profoundly wise and full of humor, I also found it to be one of the most insightful books about designing graphic user interfaces ever written, even though it never discusses the subject directly. Many of the story-telling techniques discussed are straight-forwardly applicable to graphic user interface design, which after all mixes text and graphics in a similar fashion. It includes the best description of why icons work that I have ever encountered."</em></strong></p>
<p>Please read the following articles that examine how McCloud's ideas can be applied to icon design and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy">alchemic</a> nature of combining images and words in order to convey meaning.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Answer the following questions in a text document.</p>
<ol>
<li>How does Mathis relate the creation of UI (user interface) elements to realistic representation and abstraction? How does a good icon avoid confusion?</li>
<li>Create two new progression examples like Mathis's "home" icon progression for the objects <em><strong>paint brush</strong></em> and <em><strong>trash can</strong></em>. Please create you're own iconic takes using Adobe Illustrator. Your progression should have at least seven steps. Please indicate on you progressions which version you think best represents the idea in a UI.<img src="$IMS-CC-FILEBASE$/Screen%20Shot%202014-01-11%20at%208.22.26%20PM.jpg" alt="Screen Shot 2014-01-11 at 8.22.26 PM.jpg" loading="lazy"><img src="$IMS-CC-FILEBASE$/Screen%20Shot%202014-01-11%20at%208.26.39%20PM.jpg" alt="Screen Shot 2014-01-11 at 8.26.39 PM.jpg" loading="lazy">
