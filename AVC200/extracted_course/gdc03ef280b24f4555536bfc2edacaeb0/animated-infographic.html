</head>
<body>
<p>For our next project we will be designing an animated info-graphic in Edge Animate. This project is covered in detail in the "Creating an animated Infographic in Edge Animate" on Lynda.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please watch the entire course and follow along to create your own animated infographic (we'll be adding interactivity to it next week) but use the following color palette instead of the color palette that Chris uses in the tutorial.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://color.adobe.com/My-Color-Theme-color-theme-6465275/?showPublished=true">https://color.adobe.com/My-Color-Theme-color-theme-6465275/?showPublished=true</a></p>
<p>Use your best design sense to allocate those colors amongst the design.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please ZIP your entire Edge Animate project folder and upload to this project.&nbsp;</p>
