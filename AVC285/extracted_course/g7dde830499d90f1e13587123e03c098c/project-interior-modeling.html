<h4>Project</h4>
<p>You will produce two interior scenes for this project. You will select a reference image and try to reproduce that image as accurately as possible. The second scene will be taking the work from that scene and reimagining it in your own style.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Tutorial Room</h4>

<li><a>Use this as a general substance reference</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Your Room</h4>
<p>Please select a room from a reference image and try to reproduce the image as accurately as possible. Remember the 80 x 20 rule. Select a room that you're interested in but you have a good idea how to accomplish 80 percent of the modeling and texturing. If you questions on the other 20 percent I can help. Any greater than 20 and the project becomes unfeasible. You will model, texture, and light this room.</p>
