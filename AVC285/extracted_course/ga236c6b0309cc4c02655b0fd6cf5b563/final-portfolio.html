<p>The Final Portfolio will include the following for<strong> all three games</strong> we've developed. This final portfolio is worth <strong>six times</strong> as much as a regular assignment.&nbsp;</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>A less than 2 minute video of edited gameplay. Please upload this video to Vimeo or your GCC youtube account <strong>AND </strong>upload it as an mp4 to this assignment.</li>
<li>A link to the playable <strong>OR</strong> downloadable version of the game posted on itch.io.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the end of the semester and our last meeting is our portfolio review on Monday May 8th at 4:30. <strong>This assignment will CLOSE AND LOCK on Monday May 8th at 4:30. No work will be accepted after that date.&nbsp;</strong></p>
