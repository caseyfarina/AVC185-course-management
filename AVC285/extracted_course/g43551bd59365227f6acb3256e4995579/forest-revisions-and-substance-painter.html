<p>UV unwrapping rocks and foliage for Substance painter. The audio is a little low, sorry, transitioning my home setup.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Good start everyone. The forest scenes looked good; a good start. Much of the foliage geometry was too heavy. Leaves, petals, grasses can be a single polygon thick. <strong>They do not need two sides.</strong> I'll respond on video tomorrow, but you can start on the following videos for improving the leaves, petals, and grasses. Look at the grass and the trees in the asset browser and pay particular attention to the amount of geometry.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some rock ideas: Chris Schmidt and Rocket Lasso are a must follow for C4D. He gets into rocks at the timestamp, however, you should watch the entire talk for some great fracture ideas. <a style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;" href="https://youtu.be/ENCKIrv9CLI?t=1885" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/ENCKIrv9CLI?t=1885</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these models are going to be unwrapped and painted in Substance. Please take note of the following substance painting talks.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Stylized Station's "hand painted" tutorial to guide your texture in substance painter. We are not going for a realistic look. Start are 3:30. Again this is a reference, not a tutorial. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zykNcrOODxQ" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zykNcrOODxQ</a>
</li>
<li>I think Arvid is the best Substance Painter communicator. Watch and take note on his slightly different take on stylized painting in Substance. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZsL4D4DXNY" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZsL4D4DXNY</a>

<p>Zip up the following and submit to canvas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Screen shots of all 9 objects in substance painter.</li>
<li>The fbx and the c4d file for each object (be sure to save the c4d so you can edit it later.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Create a 3 - 5 minute walk through of all the objects in substance painter explaining your color decisions, substance painter techniques, and how all the objects fit together to form a coherent world. Upload to Youtube and post to slack. Watch the other student's walk throughs and comment please :)</p>
