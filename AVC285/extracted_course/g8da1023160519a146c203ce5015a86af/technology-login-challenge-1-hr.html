</head>
<body>
<h2><em><strong><span style="font-size: 36pt;">W</span> </strong>e use a lot of technology in this class. You need to sign up for several pieces of software and web applications. This challenge is about getting that all out of the way. <a class=" inline_disabled" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqFKuImFGYQ">If you haven't watched this tutorial about taking screen captures, please do.</a></em></h2>
<p><em>If you are considering getting a new computer or borrowing a computer from GCC <strong>you can still proceed with this assignment. ALL of the licenses are transferable between computers.</strong></em></p>

<p><strong> <span style="font-size: 24pt;">MIRO </span>- for taking notes and white boarding&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>Sign up for <a class="instructure_file_link inline_disabled" href="https://miro.com/signup/" target="_blank">Miro</a>. Miro is an online <strong>white boarding/sketching/note taking tool </strong>that I enjoy because of it's ease of use and full feature set. Follow the follow tutorial for basic Miro functionality, You'll need to use Miro to compile all of the screen shots for this project. I use the large jpg export in the tutorial, this may not be available if you do not register for the full student license. <strong>Any size jpg is acceptable.</strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 24pt;">Discord </span>- the primary way to communicate with me and other classmates </strong></p>
<p>You've made it this far so you understand how to login to Canvas. We will turn in all of the projects and all of the course work will be posted on Canvas. However, the Digital Media Arts department uses Discord for day to day questions and communication. We will all congregate together on Discord.&nbsp; Our GCC Discord is organized into several channels and you should sign up for the channel for your class. For example, <strong>#avc200_farina.</strong> If you have a question about a piece of software, art, or a project, <strong>you should ask that on the Discord channel, not as a direct message&nbsp; or email to me</strong>. The public conversations<em><strong> help everyone solve problems together.</strong></em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Deliverable: what do you need to turn in?</strong></p>
<p>Upload all of your screen shots to Miro and put them in a single frame. Export that frame from Miro and then upload that single jpg to this assignment. <span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong>Don't worry about the specific size or resolution of the jpg. In the tutorial I use high resolution and that may not be available. Export your image regardless. </strong></span>Obviously higher resolution is better.</p>
