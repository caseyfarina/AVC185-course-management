<title>Assignment: A guide to deformers in Cinema 4D</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Now that you understand primitive objects, splines, and "patch" or NURB objects, all of these can be further altered with DEFORMERS.</p>
<p>Please register for a FREE (you do not need to pay for it) cineversity account.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cineversity.com/home2">https://www.cineversity.com/home2</a></p>
<p>We'll do this next presentation in group format.</p>
<p>ALL groups&nbsp;</p>
<p>Watch the first six videos in this C4D deformer series.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cineversity.com/vidplaylist/an_artists_guide_to_all_deformers_full_series/">https://www.cineversity.com/vidplaylist/an_artists_guide_to_all_deformers_full_series/</a></p>
<p>Group A</p>
<ul>
<li>BEND, FFD, Explosion, shrink wrap, wind</li>
</ul>
<p>Group B</p>
<ul>
<li>bulge, twist, morph, spline wrap, smoothing</li>
</ul>
<p>Group C</p>
<ul>
<li>shear, mesh, explosion fx, spherify, displacer</li>
</ul>
<p>Group D</p>
<ul>
<li>bevel, collision, shatter, wrap, taper, formula</li>
</ul>
<p>Group E</p>
<ul>
<li>squash stretch, melt, correction, jiggle, spline rail</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each group will have 10 minutes to present their<strong> 5 CINEMA 4D</strong> files (one for each deformer). Walk us through how to use that deformer (a new example, not the same one that Edna uses in her tutorial). Try to think about what the most useful application of this tool might be. How would it be used in Modeling? AND How could it be animated?</p>
<p>Please upload a zip file of all five C4D files.</p>
