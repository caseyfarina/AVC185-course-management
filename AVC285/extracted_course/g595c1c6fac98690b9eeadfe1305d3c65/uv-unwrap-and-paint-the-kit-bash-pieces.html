<title>Assignment: UV unwrap and paint the kit bash pieces</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Good work on the kit bash pieces!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm moving this class due dates to Wednesday for scheduling reasons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd like everyone to UV unwrap all of their kit bash pieces (adjust your modeling as necessary), then paint them in substance painter. Paint them in a similar style so they look as if they are part of the same "set." We'll be combining them to form bigger objects.</p>
<p>A good UV reference for hard surface models.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Deliverable:</strong></p>
<p>Screen shots of all 6 parts in substance painter. All 6 should look like they are part of the same "set."</p>
<p>A 3 minute walk through describing your Substance painter process. What kind of look were you going for?&nbsp;</p>
