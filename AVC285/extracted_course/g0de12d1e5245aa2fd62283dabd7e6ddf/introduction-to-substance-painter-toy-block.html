<title>Assignment: Introduction to Substance Painter: Toy Block</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>We're going to be using C4D and Substance Painter for the remainder of the semester.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you haven't already, please proceed to the following link to apply for and download Substance Painter. We won't be using Substance Designer, or Alchemist or any of the other Algorithmic&nbsp; (now Adobe) software but if you have room it's probably a good idea to put the other programs on your home computers.</p>

<p><strong>What is Substance Painter?</strong> A separate piece of software that is designed to make detailed textures and materials MUCH easier. This is the software to use when painting high fidelity materials onto your models.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What isn't Substance Painter?</strong> It is not a modeling tool. All your modeling and UV unwrapping will still need to be done in Cinema 4D.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're going to start by&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Modeling a simple toy block in Cinema 4D</li>
<li>UV unwrapping the toy block in Cinema 4D</li>
</ol>
