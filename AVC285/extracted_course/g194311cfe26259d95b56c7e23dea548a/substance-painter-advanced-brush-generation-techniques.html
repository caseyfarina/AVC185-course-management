<title>Assignment: Substance Painter: Advanced brush generation techniques</title>
</head>
<body>
<h3><strong>&nbsp;  </strong></h3>
<h2><strong>Assignment Overview:</strong></h2>
<p><span>This assignment focuses on the procedural creation of multi-layered brushes for Substance Painter using Blender. The objective is to develop brushes that can be dynamically adjusted and applied in Substance Painter to enhance textural detail and complexity in 3D models.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Instruction:</strong></h2>
<p>Before you begin, familiarize yourself with the following advanced techniques in Substance Painter:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Using the cloner to create a procedural alpha generator, </strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Using the multi-pass renderer in Blender to generate Substance brush layers:</strong></li>

<h2><strong>Project Objective:</strong></h2>
<p>Revise and reimagine your Mat painting by adding the following and improving on last week's design.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Add at least two procedural brushes that include an
<ul>
<li>alpha</li>
<li>emissive (ID map)</li>
<li>Height map</li>
<li>Use the Baked ID map to drive several layer mask</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Vary the base color across the surface of your project by using a mesh map color overlay</li>
<li>Use the "mask outline" effect at least once</li>
<li>How is this Mat an improvement on last week's design?</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Deliverables:</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Canvas Submission</strong>: Submit the following in a zip file:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your final Substance Painter project file.</li>
<li>A set of rendered images showcasing your textured model from multiple angles. (screen grabs of Substance Painter, or renders from Iray)</li>
<li>A &lt; 3 minute video tour of your Mat texturing.<strong> Explain which techniques you used,</strong> and how the implemented techniques support your artistic vision for Mat.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Discord Engagement</strong>: Share your project renders on the designated Discord channel and engage with at least three peers' submissions. Provide constructive feedback focusing on their use of advanced techniques in Substance Painter, and share any insights or discoveries you made during your project.</p>
