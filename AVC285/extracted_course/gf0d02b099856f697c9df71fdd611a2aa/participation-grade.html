<title>Assignment: Participation Grade</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Each week you earn participation points. These points represent 25% of your final grade. I will answer these questions in a Q &amp; A video each week. The Q &amp; A video will be posted to the youtube channel. Please watch the Q &amp; A video each week. I would highly recommend that you watch all the questions, not just fast forward to your question.&nbsp;</p>
