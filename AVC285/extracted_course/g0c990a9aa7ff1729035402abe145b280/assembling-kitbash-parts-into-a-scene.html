<title>Assignment: Assembling kitbash parts into a scene</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The next step in the process to build an environment or scene from the kitbash parts we've all constructed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My suggestion for laying out the scene is to construct a machine or mechanism that will serve as the focal point of the environment. Then build the environment around that machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use all of the following</p>
<ul>
<li>Your kitbash parts</li>
<li>The parts shared by fellow students. You may need to alter the look and feel of these parts to match your parts. Please zip up all of your substance painter files and post to google drive. Share this link on slack in case other students want to make changes to the appearance of the shared parts.</li>
<li>
</li><li>Feel free to model additional parts if necessary, but try not to get sidetracked. <strong>Consider using the hard surface sculpting workflow we detailed.&nbsp;</strong>

<li>Also Bel figured out how to consistently use the built in alphas in Cinema 4D, you have to access them through the presets menu

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consider the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use the same parts at different scales (you should recreate the textures in Substance Painter with more detail for the bigger parts).</li>
<li>Use the wires for connecting components and building detail</li>
<li>Build an entire scene. Use the kitbash parts to make the design of the walls and floors of your scene&nbsp; reflect the design language of the centerpiece object</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Deliverable</strong></p>
<p>Save your C4D project with assets. Please save that folder to your google drive and share it with "anyone with link." Please submit that folder link to Canvas. Create a three minute walk through of your design process and post that video to youtube and link on slack. Discuss which parts you made and which parts you used from other student libraries.&nbsp;</p>
