</head>
<body>
<p>Revise and improve your Photogrammetry scene. Rescan objects that were not successful or select new objects that will be more "scanable" based on your current knowledge. Create a coherent artistic scene from your scans and other objects.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Deliverable:</strong> A zip containing</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>A three shot render of the scene from Unreal using the Level Sequence editor.&nbsp;
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Each shot should have linear camera animation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A three minute OBS recording of a tour of your scene
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>What changes did you make?</li>
<li>Respond to the your feedback from the previous week.</li>
<li>Which tools did you use this week?</li>
<li>How did it go retopologizing your own scan?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Post the unreal render to the discord channel and comment on everyone else's render.</p>
