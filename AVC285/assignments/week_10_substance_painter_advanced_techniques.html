<title>Assignment: Substance Painter: Advanced Techniques</title>
</head>
<body>

<h2><strong>Assignment Overview:</strong></h2>
<p>This project invites you to explore the depths of Substance Painter's capabilities, focusing on advanced techniques that will elevate your texturing and material creation skills. By integrating assets from Blender and utilizing sophisticated features within Substance Painter, you will create a visually compelling 3D asset that showcases detailed texturing and material effects.</p>
<h2><strong>Instruction:</strong></h2>
<p>Before you begin, familiarize yourself with the following advanced techniques in Substance Painter:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Baking Normal Details from a High Poly Mesh and Introduction to Anchor Points:</strong>

<li><strong>Understanding Anchor Points in Substance Painter</strong>: Learn how to use anchor points to create complex layering and material effects.</li>
<li><strong>Baking Normal Details Using a High Poly Mesh</strong>: Discover how to leverage high poly meshes to bake detailed normal maps in Substance Painter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Photogrammetry Review and Using Blender to create Substance Painter Materials:</strong>

</ul>
<h2><strong>Project Objective:</strong></h2>
<p>Your task is to create a <strong>RetroFuture or Technological</strong> rendering of <strong>Mat</strong> (the Substance Painter default example mesh). <img src="$IMS-CC-FILEBASE$/Uploaded%20Media/image-25d473a0-0532-44a8-9a66-8a28119fc4c2.png" alt="Substance Painter interface or texturing workflow" width="512" height="227" data-api-endpoint="https://learn.maricopa.edu/api/v1/courses/1316263/files/106628573" data-api-returntype="File" loading="lazy"></p>
<ul>
<li>Use all of the techniques we discussed this week at least once</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Utilization of Anchor Points for dynamic texturing effects.</li>
<li>Baking of normal details from a high poly mesh to enhance realism.</li>
<li>Development of materials using height maps and emissive maps derived from Blender multipass renders.</li>
<li>Experiment with these techniques to present an artistically consistent texturing of Mat. Please texture all of Mat, not just the head.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Deliverables:</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Canvas Submission</strong>: Submit the following in a zip file:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your final Substance Painter project file.</li>
<li>A set of rendered images showcasing your textured model from multiple angles. (screen grabs of Substance Painter, or renders from Iray)</li>
