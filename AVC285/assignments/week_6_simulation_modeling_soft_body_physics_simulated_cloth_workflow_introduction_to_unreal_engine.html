<p>Project: Create the following scenes</p>
<ul>
<li>A bouncing animation that uses keyframes and soft body simulation create an animation that exemplifies the Principles of Motion Graphics.
<ul>
<li>Blend keyframes and simulation physics</li>
<li>include interaction between soft and rigid bodies</li>
<li>include cloth tearing</li>
<li>Render a "client Preview" of the scene using the Viewport renderer in Blender. Try to make the render as high fidelity as possible while still rendering very quickly with the Viewport Renderer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A screen capture (use OBS) of simulated clothing on a motion capture figure in Unreal engine. Consider the following
<ul>
<li>Design of the clothing</li>
<li>Use an Alembic to transfer from Blender to Unreal</li>
<li>Consider the difference between Blender and Unreal Engine. Unreal is a Realtime game engine, how does that affect its structure and functionality?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
